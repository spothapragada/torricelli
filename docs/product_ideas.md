# Ideas for Feature and Core Design

## 02/05/2020 - From Tiffany

* Connect a physical barometric sensor device to a database and collect data _*in situ*_. 
* Create functionality in the app to prompt the user for migraine symptoms
    * Create a wireframe for the symptoms page to collect data
* Show user a view of the changing pressure conditions and how they 'feel',something akin to time series. 
    * Show prevailing conditions in a certain mile radius(?) and how other users may be feeling as well
